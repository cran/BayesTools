Title: Tools for Bayesian Analyses
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Provides tools for conducting Bayesian analyses. The package contains 
    functions for creating a wide range of prior distribution objects, mixing posterior 
    samples from 'JAGS' and 'Stan' models, plotting posterior distributions, and etc...
    The tools for working with prior distribution span from visualization, generating 'JAGS' 
    and 'bridgesampling' syntax to basic functions such as rng, quantile, and distribution functions.
