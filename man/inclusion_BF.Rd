\title{Compute inclusion Bayes factors}
\usage{
inclusion_BF(prior_probs, post_probs, margliks, is_null)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior_probs}{vector of prior model probabilities}

\item{post_probs}{vector of posterior model probabilities}

\item{margliks}{vector of marginal likelihoods.}

\item{is_null}{logical vector of indicators whether the model corresponds
to the null or alternative hypothesis (or an integer vector indexing models
corresponding to the null hypothesis)}
}
\value{
\code{inclusion_BF} returns a Bayes factor.
}
\description{
Computes inclusion Bayes factors based on prior model probabilities,
posterior model probabilities (or marginal likelihoods), and indicator whether
the models represent the null or alternative hypothesis.
}
\details{
Supplying \code{margliks} as the input is preferred since it is better at dealing with
under/overflow (posterior probabilities are very close to either 0 or 1). In case that both the
\code{post_probs} and \code{margliks} are supplied, the results are based on \code{margliks}.
